## Namaste JavaScript

This repo contains my personal notes from the Namaste JavaScript YouTube series by Akshay Saini. I'm following the course to revise core JavaScript concepts and internalsâ€”like Closures, Promises, Event Loop, and more. Great for interview prep and understanding how JavaScript works under the hood.
